# d3-chart

A small, hackable, d3-esque charting library.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-plot`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/atdyer/d3-chart/releases/latest).

Note that while the plugin is called d3-chart, that name was already taken in NPM, so in NPM the plugin is called d3-plot. The difference is only in name, all functionality is otherwise identical.
