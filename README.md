# d3-chart

**Note: This plugin is under heavy development and there are no releases yet, use at your own risk. The API is subject to change at any time.**

d3-chart is a charting plugin for D3 4.0. It began as an extension to the time-series-chart.js example from Mike Bostock's post on [reusable charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) and has gradually evolved into a full-fledged charting plugin for D3.

The d3-chart plugin provides you with extensions to D3 for generating charts using the D3 coding conventions you've become familiar with (e.g. configurable functions and method chaining). Essentially I've compiled all of that margin/axis/scale code that you see in all of the D3 examples down to a more reusable API and thrown in a few features that I find myself constantly rewriting every time I make chart.

## Installing

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/atdyer/d3-chart/releases/latest) and include ```d3-chart.js``` or ```d3-chart.min.js``` in your web page along with D3 4.0.
