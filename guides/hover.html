        <h2>Hover vs. Mouse</h2>
        <p>
            Each plottable has two sets of 'hover' related methods:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            .hover_in()
            .hover()
            .hover_out()
        </code></pre>
        <p>and</p>
        <pre><code>
            .mouse_in()
            .mouse_move()
            .mouse_out()
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            This may seem redundant, and while the two are closely related, they serve very different purposes.
            The <code>.hover()</code> set of methods are the getter/setter methods. They are used to get or set the
            function to be called during each event. So passing a function to <code>.hover_in()</code> sets the function
            that will be called when the mouse enters the hover area. <code>.hover()</code> sets the function that is
            called when the mouse is moved while in the hover area, and <code>.hover_out()</code> sets the function that
            is called when the mouse leaves the hover area.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the <code>.mouse_()</code> set of methods are the actual event handlers. When the mouse
            enters the hover area, the <code>.mouse_in()</code> method is called and is responsible for calling the
            function that was set using <code>.hover_in()</code>. Similarly, the <code>.mouse_move()</code> method is
            called when the mouse moves, and is responsible for calling the function set by <code>.hover()</code>, and
            the <code>.mouse_out()</code> method is called when the mouse leaves the hover area, and is responsible for
            calling the function set by <code>.hover_out()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to keep the getter/setter methods separate from the event handlers because we don't want the
            event firing when using the getter. Additionally, as a result of keeping them separated, the
            <code>.hover()</code> set of methods are chainable, and should be used in the context of building a chart,
            while the <code>.mouse()</code> set of methods are <em>not</em> chainable, and should be used in the context
            of an event firing.
