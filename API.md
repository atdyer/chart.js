# chart.js API

chart.js is a small, hackable, d3-esque charting library. It is designed to be used in concert with D3 4.0. It began as an extension to the time-series-chart.js example from Mike Bostock's post on [reusable charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/). As I was building charts for various projects, I often found myself starting with that code and adding functionality or hacking away at it to fit my needs, so I decided to start building my own version that would accumulate these new features. My hope is that this library will provide enough functionality to get charts 90% of the way there, and that the documentation and examples will be good enough that the last 10% is easily obtainable by making simple changes to the code as needed.
